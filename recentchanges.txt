********** BBSTANLIB's name has changed!!!! **********
the library will hereafter be known as MATSTANLIB.


********** BIG CHANGES **********
- added CALCULATEWAIC (which accepts samples of log likelihood).
- added PLOTDIVERGENCES. this generates a rug plot of divergences BY CHAIN.  (if all divergences are seen in a single chain, you can just remove the chain with REMOVECHAIN.)
- you can now use a wildcard in parameter requests!!!!!
        e.g., say beta is indexed by participant and subject.  you can now request 'beta[*,1]'
        e.g., say your hyperparameters for beta are mu_beta[1], mu_beta[2] and sigma_beta --- you can now request all of these with '*_beta*'
- MULTIDENSITY can now highlight divergent samples in RED as an overlay.
- INTERPRETDIAGNOSTICS now outputs 1 if the convergernce/divergence criteria have been satisfied, and 0 otherwise.  (this is useful for automating re-running a model if not converged.)
- TRACEDIVERGENT can now accomodate a parameter request (and thus generate multiple plots in a single call) **********************************
- changed the name of POSTERIORPRED to POSTPREDHIST to avoid reasonably expected conflicts.
- EXPANDPARAMNAMES will be removed in a future release.  please edit your scripts to instead use the new function GETPARAMINSTANCES.
- added GETPARAMINSTANCES.  this function takes in a SAMPLES structure and returns the names of all parameter instances (i.e., indexed parameters).  note that:
    --- this function supersedes EXPANDPARAMNAMES.
    --- there is a user-friendly, default syntax for this function which accepts SAMPLES directly, intended to be used when called from a script
    --- there is a RAM-friendly, alternative syntax for this function which does not require passing SAMPLES, intended to be used when called from a function (i.e., to avoid storing multiple copies of SAMPLES in memory)
- added EXTRACTSAMPLES_TRINITY for users who wish to use Trinity in place of MATLABStan.
- added COMPUTEHDI for computing highest-density intervals (HDIs).  


********** MEDIUM CHANGES **********
- line colors in PLOTLP now match line colos in TRACEDENSITY and TRACEDIVERGENT for easier reconciling.
- the rug plot of divergences seen in PLOTLP and TRACEDIVERGENT is now chain-by-chain.
- MULTIDENSITY no longer returns a matrix of handles --- so no need to add a trailing semicolon to calls to this function
- CATERPLOT now displays 50% credible intervals (thick lines) in addition to 95% credible intervals (thin lines).
- CATERPLOT can now 
    --- accept a custom sorting order.  
    --- return the sorting order seen on the plot.
- CATERPLOT now returns a matrix of indices matching the sorting order.
- you may now submit a custom color to CATERPLOT. 
- you may now submit a custom fill, outline, and marker color to VIOLINDENSITY.


********** SMALL CHANGES **********
- cosmetic changes to various plotting functions.
- many small edits to SKELETON (the base MATSTANLIB script)
